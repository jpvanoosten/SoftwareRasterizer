# Arkanoid

Arkanoid is an arcade game developed by [Taito][1] in 1986. Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games and specifically of [Atari][2]'s 1978 classic, [Super Breakout][3] in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level<sup>[4][4]</sup>.
